Suppose that we call scanf as follows:\
scanf("%f%d%f", &x, &i, &y);\
If the user enters\
12.3 45.6 789\
what will be the values of x, i and y after the call? (Assume that x and y are float variables and i is an int variable.)

The first %f stores 12.3 into x -> %d stores 45 into i -> the last %f stores .6 into y
